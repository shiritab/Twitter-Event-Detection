# Twitter-Event-Detection

## Intro: 
this project aims to provide solution for data scientist that works in the area of
twitter even detection. this site will alow them to compare between different algorithms and to watch at the
visualizations result of the classification between algorithms that runs over the same data sets.
## Frontend: 
Currently supports:
  1. watch all the tweets that compose event.
  2. select events by date from the events page
  3. select an algorithm on trending page - sedwik or twembeddings
## Backend: 
Currently supports:
  1. sedwik and twembedding are integrated with server 
  2. integration between server and client 
  3. project was depolyed in university server and is ready for action
